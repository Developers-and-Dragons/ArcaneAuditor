Custom Rules Package

This package is for user-defined validation rules that extend the Arcane Auditor.

IMPORTANT: 
- Use CUSTOM### rule IDs (e.g., CUSTOM001, CUSTOM002) to avoid conflicts with official rules
- Place your custom rules in the 'user/' subdirectory
- See examples/ directory for reference implementations
- Check README.md for detailed documentation

Official rule ID ranges:
- SCRIPT001-SCRIPT999: Script validation rules
- STRUCT001-STRUCT999: Structure validation rules  
- STYLE001-STYLE999: Style/naming rules
- CUSTOM001-CUSTOM999: Custom user rules (reserved for you!)
