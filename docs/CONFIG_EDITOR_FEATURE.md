# Configuration Editor Feature Documentation

## üìã Overview

The Configuration Editor is a new web interface feature that allows users to visually edit validation rule configurations through an interactive modal editor. This addresses [Issue #10](https://github.com/Developers-and-Dragons/ArcaneAuditor/issues/10) by providing write capabilities for configuration files.

**Key Benefits:**
- ‚úèÔ∏è Visual editing of personal and team configurations
- üîí Built-in presets are protected from accidental modification
- üéöÔ∏è Quick enable/disable rules with toggle switches
- ‚öôÔ∏è Edit custom settings for each rule with JSON validation
- üîç Search and filter rules for easy navigation
- üíæ Save changes directly from the web interface

---

## üéØ Feature Capabilities

### What You Can Do

#### ‚úÖ Enable/Disable Rules
- Toggle individual rules on/off with visual switches
- See immediate visual feedback when changing rule status
- Status badge updates in real-time

#### ‚úÖ Edit Rule Settings
- Change severity overrides (ACTION ‚Üî ADVICE)
- Configure custom rule-specific settings via JSON editor
- JSON validation prevents invalid configurations

#### ‚úÖ Search & Filter
- **Search by name**: Find rules instantly by typing partial names
- **Filter options**:
  - All rules
  - Enabled rules only
  - Disabled rules only
  - Rules with custom settings

#### ‚úÖ Save Configurations
- Save changes to personal configurations (`config/personal/`)
- Save changes to team configurations (`config/teams/`)
- **Cannot** modify built-in presets (`config/presets/`) - they're protected

### What You Cannot Do

#### ‚ùå Edit Built-in Presets
Built-in presets (`development`, `production-ready`) are read-only because:
- They get overwritten during application updates
- Modifying them could break expected behavior
- You should create a personal/team config instead

**Solution:** Copy a preset's settings and create your own configuration.

#### ‚ùå Delete Configurations
Currently, deletion must be done manually by removing the JSON file from `config/personal/` or `config/teams/`.

#### ‚ùå Create New Configurations
The current interface only supports editing existing configurations. To create a new one:
1. Manually create a JSON file in `config/personal/` or `config/teams/`
2. Use the command-line tool: `uv run main.py generate-config > config/personal/my-config.json`
3. Refresh the web interface to see your new configuration

## üöÄ How to Test the Feature

### Prerequisites

1. **Start the web server:**
   ```bash
   cd ArcaneAuditor
   ./start-web-service.sh
   ```

   The server will automatically open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`

2. **Create a test configuration** (if you don't have one):
   ```bash
   # Copy the development preset to personal
   mkdir -p config/personal
   cp config/presets/development.json config/personal/test-config.json
   ```

### Test Workflow

#### Step 1: Access the Configuration Editor

1. Open the web interface (`http://localhost:8080`)
2. Scroll to the **‚öôÔ∏è Analysis Configuration** section
3. You'll see configuration cards grouped by type:
   - **Built-in** (presets from Arcane Auditor)
   - **Team** (shared team configurations)
   - **Personal** (your personal configurations)

#### Step 2: Select a Configuration

1. Click on a configuration card to select it
2. The card will highlight and show action buttons
3. **For built-in presets**: You'll only see "üìã View Details"
4. **For personal/team configs**: You'll see both "üìã View Details" and "‚úèÔ∏è Edit"

#### Step 3: Open the Editor

1. Click the **‚úèÔ∏è Edit** button on a personal or team configuration
2. The Configuration Editor modal will open
3. You should see:
   - Editor title showing which config you're editing
   - Search bar at the top
   - Filter dropdown (All Rules / Enabled Only / Disabled Only / Has Custom Settings)
   - Scrollable list of all validation rules

#### Step 4: Test Rule Toggling

1. Find any rule in the list
2. Click the toggle switch on the left
3. Observe:
   - The switch animates to the new position
   - The status text changes ("‚úì Enabled" ‚Üî "‚úó Disabled")
   - The rule's `data-enabled` attribute updates
4. Toggle it back to confirm it works both ways

#### Step 5: Test Search Functionality

1. In the search bar, type: `Script`
2. Observe:
   - Only rules with "Script" in their name are shown
   - Other rules are hidden
   - Search is case-insensitive
3. Clear the search to see all rules again

#### Step 6: Test Filter Functionality

1. Open the filter dropdown
2. Select "Enabled Only"
3. Observe:
   - Only enabled rules are displayed
   - Disabled rules are hidden
4. Try other filter options:
   - "Disabled Only"
   - "Has Custom Settings"
5. Return to "All Rules"

#### Step 7: Test Settings Panel

1. Find a rule (like `ScriptLongBlockRule` which has custom settings)
2. Click the "‚öôÔ∏è Settings" button
3. The settings panel expands showing:
   - **Severity Override** dropdown
   - **Custom Settings** JSON textarea
4. Try changing the severity from ADVICE to ACTION or vice versa
5. Try editing the JSON in the custom settings:
   ```json
   {
     "max_lines": 50,
     "skip_comments": true,
     "skip_blank_lines": true
   }
   ```

#### Step 8: Test Saving

1. Make a few changes:
   - Toggle a rule on/off
   - Change a severity
   - Modify custom settings
2. Click the **üíæ Save Changes** button at the bottom
3. Observe:
   - If successful, you'll see "Configuration saved successfully!"
   - If there's a JSON error, you'll see an error message
   - The modal closes automatically on success
4. Verify the changes were saved:
   - Open your config file (`config/personal/test-config.json`)
   - Confirm your changes are present

#### Step 9: Test Built-in Preset Protection

1. Select a built-in preset (like "Development" or "Production Ready")
2. Observe:
   - No "‚úèÔ∏è Edit" button appears
   - Only "üìã View Details" is available
3. Click "üìã View Details" to see the breakdown
4. This confirms built-in presets are protected

## üîß Technical Details

### API Endpoints

#### POST `/api/configs/{config_id}`
Saves changes to an existing configuration.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "RuleName": {
      "enabled": true,
      "severity_override": "ACTION",
      "custom_settings": {}
    }
  },
  "file_processing": { ... },
  "output": { ... }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Configuration saved to config/personal/test-config.json"
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `400`: Invalid config ID format
- `403`: Attempting to edit a built-in preset
- `500`: File write error

#### POST `/api/configs/create`
Creates a new configuration file.

**Note:** Not yet implemented in the UI, but the API endpoint exists for future use.

### File Structure

```
config/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ presets/           # Built-in (read-only)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ development.json
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ production-ready.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ teams/             # Team configs (editable)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ team-config.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ personal/          # Personal configs (editable)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-config.json
```

### Configuration ID Format

Configurations are identified by: `{config_name}_{source}`

Examples:
- `development_presets` - Built-in development preset
- `test-config_personal` - Personal test configuration
- `strict-rules_teams` - Team strict rules configuration

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **No visual diff**: Changes aren't highlighted until after save
2. **No undo/redo**: Once saved, changes are permanent (edit the file manually to revert)
3. **No real-time validation**: JSON errors are only caught on save
4. **No configuration creation**: Must create JSON files manually or via CLI
5. **No configuration deletion**: Must delete JSON files manually

---

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### For Configuration Management

1. **Start with a preset**: Copy `development.json` or `production-ready.json` to personal
2. **Use descriptive names**: Name your configs clearly (e.g., `frontend-strict.json`)
3. **Test before deploying**: Use personal configs to test rule changes before promoting to team
4. **Document custom settings**: Add comments in your config file (outside the JSON) to explain why specific rules are configured

### For Editing Rules

1. **Search before scrolling**: Use the search bar to find specific rules quickly
2. **Filter to focus**: Use filters to focus on enabled rules you want to fine-tune
3. **Expand one at a time**: Keep only one settings panel open to avoid confusion
4. **Validate JSON**: Use a JSON validator if you're unsure about your custom settings syntax
5. **Save frequently**: Save after each logical group of changes

### For Custom Settings

Examples of common custom settings:

```json
// ScriptLongBlockRule - adjust max lines and skip options
{
  "max_lines": 50,
  "skip_comments": true,
  "skip_blank_lines": true
}

// ScriptNestingLevelRule - change maximum nesting depth
{
  "max_nesting_level": 4
}

// ScriptDescriptiveParameterRule - allow specific single-letter params
{
  "allowed_single_letters": ["i", "j", "x", "y"]
}
```
