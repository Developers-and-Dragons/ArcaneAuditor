# Quick Testing Guide: Configuration Editor

This guide will help you quickly test the new configuration editor feature.

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Start the Server
```bash
cd ArcaneAuditor
./start-web-service.sh
```

Your browser will automatically open to `http://localhost:8080`

### Step 2: Create a Test Configuration
```bash
# In a new terminal
cd ArcaneAuditor
mkdir -p config/personal
cp config/presets/development.json config/personal/test-config.json
```

### Step 3: Refresh the Browser
Refresh the page to see your new `test-config` appear in the Personal section.

### Step 4: Test the Editor

1. **Click** on the "Test Config" card to select it
2. **Click** the "‚úèÔ∏è Edit" button that appears
3. **Try these actions**:
   - Toggle a rule on/off using the switch
   - Search for "Script" in the search bar
   - Change the filter to "Enabled Only"
   - Click "Settings" on a rule and expand it
   - Edit the JSON in the custom settings
   - Click "üíæ Save Changes"

4. **Verify** the changes saved:
   ```bash
   cat config/personal/test-config.json | grep -A 5 "ScriptLongBlockRule"
   ```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: No Edit button appears
**Solution:** Make sure you're selecting a personal or team config, not a built-in preset.

### Issue: Configurations don't load
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check server logs: `tail -f /tmp/server.log`
3. Verify the `/api/configs` endpoint works: `curl http://localhost:8080/api/configs`

### Issue: Cannot save changes
**Solution:**
1. Check if your JSON is valid
2. Verify file permissions on `config/personal/` directory
3. Check server logs for permission errors

### Issue: Changes don't persist
**Solution:**
1. Verify the success message appeared
2. Check the timestamp on the config file: `ls -l config/personal/test-config.json`
3. Reload the page and check if changes are visible

echo "2Ô∏è‚É£ Testing API..."
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/health | grep "healthy" && echo "‚úÖ Server is healthy" || echo "‚ùå Server not responding"

# 3. Test configs endpoint
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/configs | grep "configs" && echo "‚úÖ Configs API works" || echo "‚ùå Configs API failed"
