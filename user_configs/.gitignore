# User Configurations - Protected from App Updates
# 
# This directory contains user-created configurations that should
# survive application updates. These files are excluded from git
# to prevent conflicts during updates.

# Ignore all JSON configuration files
*.json

# But keep the examples directory
!examples/
!examples/*.json

# Keep documentation
!README.md
